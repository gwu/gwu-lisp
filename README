gwu-lisp - Java library for generating lisp code.


    This is a simple collection of Java classes for generating lisp
    code.  LispElement objects can be constructed in a tree structure.
    Calling LispElement.toString() will return the element's
    representation as lisp code.




To build just the jar:

    Run 'mvn package' to build target/gwu-lisp-${version}.jar.




To install the maven artifact:

    Run 'mvn install' to install it to your local maven repository.
    To use gwu-lisp in another maven project, add the following to the
    build dependencies in its pom.xml file:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.garrettwu.lisp</groupId>
      <artifactId>gwu-lisp</artifactId>
      <version>${version}</version>
      <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
